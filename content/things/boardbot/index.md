For Olin's Principles of Engineering Course, I designed and built a whiteboard
drawing robot with a team of four other students. Over the course of the six
weeks we spent on the project, I fulfilled various software, hardware, design,
and management roles.

A documentation website is part of the final course submissions, which is
available at <https://scrumbledeggs.github.io>.
