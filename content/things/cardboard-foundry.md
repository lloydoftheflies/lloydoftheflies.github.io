I made this with [Matt Beaudouin-Lafon](frenchmatt.com), my (older) [sibb](https://olinorientation2013.tumblr.com/post/60335830075/sibb-bbq) at Olin. Over the course of a week, we drafted, fabricated, and assembled a scale model of the Foundry.


You can view [the model and cutsheet in Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ffda1f06f73a8dd80a1331b5/w/bfd5544093cea04242dd0be3/e/73da0bf7b27eda25e0216dc6).
