I made this with [Matt Beaudouin-Lafon](frenchmatt.com), my (older) [sibb](https://olinorientation2013.tumblr.com/post/60335830075/sibb-bbq) at Olin. Over the course of a week, we drafted, fabricated, and assembled a 1:100 scale model of the Foundry, a building that the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority is turning into a community space.

<!-- TODO: describe more about the foundry/CRA, why it was made -->

We designed [the model in Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ffda1f06f73a8dd80a1331b5/w/bfd5544093cea04242dd0be3/e/73da0bf7b27eda25e0216dc6), and built it out of laser-cut single-ply cardboard and glue.
It was a lot of fun working with a fairly complex CAD model, and considering how all of the pieces together was an interesting problem.
