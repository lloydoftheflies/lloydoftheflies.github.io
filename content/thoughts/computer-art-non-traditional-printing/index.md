<!-- Lead-in -->
For my final 4 credits of general Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences (AHS) that Olin requires, I've decided to partake in an independent study that connects several threads from the past four years.

- The summer after my first year, the Olin Library funded a trip to NYC for myself and three other students to participate in [a workshop](https://github.com/runemadsen/programming-design-systems-workshop) by [Rune Madsen](https://runemadsen.com/) on [Programming Design Systems](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/), where I learned [p5](https://newsch.github.io/p5_playground/) and [paperjs](https://newsch.github.io/paperjs/).
- My final project for the [Principles of Engineering course](/tags/poe) was a whiteboard-drawing robot.
- I worked on a drum-based plotting robot for Olin's Remaking Education conference.
- Over the 2019 summer I went to [Plotter People NYC](https://plotterpeople.github.io/nyc) and met a variety of artists working in the space of robots and art.
- Last semester I bought a massive HP DraftMaster Pro on Craigslist.

Five other people will be joining me on the journey:
[Adam Novotny](https://labseven.space),
[Dieter Brehm](https://dieterbrehm.com/),
[Colin Takeda](https://colintakeda.com/),
[Charlie Weiss](https://charlieweiss.info/),
and [Alex Hindelang](https://www.olin.edu/blog/the-olinsider/category/alex-%2722/).

We'll be advised by the wonderful [Robert Wechsler](https://robertwechsler.com/) and [Tim Sauder](https://www.americansflags.net/).

We’re inspired by works like this ([K-002-090 by Carl Lostritto](http://lostritto.com/drawing)).

## Overview

When someone wants to learn how to paint, they might start by learning
the history of the practice through art history. At the same time, they
dive into the tools and supplies of the craft—Watercolors, inks, oils,
and more. To bring skill and confidence under their belts, they study
and imitate the works of the masters to explore how they experienced
art. At the end of their studies, they experience a point of deviation,
where the skills and context they’ve accumulated allows them to rough
out an unexplored path for themselves.

In the vein of an amateur painter, we want to take a semester to study
within the space of visual computer art. Broadly, this is any work of
art where a computer plays some role in the work’s lifetime. Based on my
(Evan’s) previous experience and abilities, I’m most interested in 2D
vector-based computer art, and various methods of creating physical
media from it. I got an old HP pen plotter off of Craigslist last
semester and I’ve been dying to work with it ever since. Printing pieces
with it will take a fair bit of programming work, which I’ve been
building up to over the past two semesters.

Computer art touches elements of design, engineering, and the inherent
meaning of connecting those topics. We will also consider methods,
hacks, and techniques for printing and reproducing art works in the
physical world.

As a historical motivation for our studies, we will look back at the
history and context of rule-based, generative, art works. By reflecting
on readings focusing on the philosophy of machine-made art and design,
we hope to expand our literacy in the form. This will include consuming
and recreating the works of masters in the field. We will also research
and reach out to contemporary artists in this sphere, to learn about the
current motivations and explorations that others are doing.

## Faculty Support

Robert Wechsler and Tim Sauder

## Learning Outcomes

- *Acquire Knowledge, Skills, and Approaches*  
  Through our model of going through weekly cycles, we will approach
  different submediums within generative art with a goal of learning new
  ways to express ourselves theoretically and technically.

- *Develop and Apply Creativity*  
  At its heart, this study is built around expressing our discoveries
  and ideas in new ways. The study is a testing ground for alternative
  ways to think and to create, and along the way we hope it will
  synthesize new modes of thought.

- *Communicate Effectively*  
  On a weekly basis, we will come together and share out our sketches,
  results, and how we feel about the process of creating. We are also
  excited to thoroughly document our experiments, in the form of an
  anthology or gallery show at the end of the semester which represents
  our journey.

- *Collaborate Successfully*  
  As much as this study is about exploring the self, it is also about
  learning to share that with others and have that discussion lead to
  new avenues of art. We will meet weekly to inspire each other, perform
  critiques, and question how we can push our new craft further.

- *Become Self-Directed Learners*  
  There is no guidebook or definitive textbook when it comes to
  traditional visual art, and the same is true for generative art. By
  coming together, imagining what a course in generative art could be,
  and then testing implementations of it, we carve our own self-directed
  paths.

- *Develop Personal and Professional Identity*  
  By exploring our aesthetic tastes through creating and analyzing
  artwork and texts, we will develop our personal styles. Creating a
  portfolio of artwork will allow us to demonstrate our interests and
  skills to the rest of the world.

## Folks

Evan Lloyd New-Schmidt, Adam Novotny, Dieter Brehm, Charlie Weiss, Colin
Takeda, Alex Hindelang

## Assessment Plan

Progress will be demonstrated through the weekly cycle:

- Artworks - bringing creations to share/crit/review (multiple
  pieces per week)

- Blog Posts - Discussing group readings and researching the
  historical and contemporary context of computer art. (1 blog post
  per week)

- Notebook/Sketchbook - documenting process, ideas, inspirations

- Group collaborative final efforts and presentation

### Cycles

On a weekly basis, we’ll dive into a topic, style, or practice and make
*something*. Individuals may or may not choose the same pursuit, and may
continue the same pursuit across multiple weeks. Throughout the week,
we’ll discuss and work with each other, culminating in a share-out and
critique of our work as a group at the end of the week.

### Discussions

Following our cycle critiques, we’ll discuss new topics and readings and
start the week anew. Everyone is bringing their own background and
interests to this study, and we see a wide variety of topics to cover.
