This semester I'll be undertaking an Independent Study, or _ISR-G_, that I'm particularly excited about. What follows is the proposal I submitted:

# Pennies, Pondering, and Personal Art Projects

_4-Credit ISR-G Plan of Study/Assessment Plan_

Robert Wechsler is currently an _Artist in Residence_ for Olin.

I've already some spent time working with him for the ReMaking Education conference, and I think I have a lot to learn from his perspective, experience, and work.

This semester I'll be working with him on a long-running art project involving a penny robot, as well as have opportunities to develop my own projects and style with his advice and critique.

Robert's work is generally sculptural, using a variety of mediums that at times intersect with the electromechanical.

With a B.A. in Studio Art from UCSB, Robert has a formal training in the arts, as well as several years of experience.

You can view more at his website: http://robertwechsler.com/.

## Topics

### Penny Robot

Robert (with others) has created a robot to identify, align, and cut pennies for use in his projects, with the ultimate goal of creating a million-penny cube. It was last used in California, and is currently disassembled.

Goals for this semester include:
- Reassemble, align and test the robot
- improve documentation
- improve efficiency and design
- add functionality to the machine:
  - sorting by color/year
  - partial assembly of pennies

### Personal Art Projects

Throughout the semester I'll be working on personal art projects on a roughly 3-week schedule. Each week will involve a check-in with Robert and an iteration, culminating in a final iteration and a critique from Robert. This is loosely based on the format of projects from [Mimi's _Creative Approaches to Emerging Technologies_ course](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/Creative-Approaches).
Each exploration will include documentation of my process and a writeup on my website.

### Readings and Discussions

On a weekly basis I'll do some recommended reading from him and/or the aforementioned [_Creative Approaches_ course](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/Creative-Approaches) and discuss them.

### Robert's Work

There's some opportunity for community engagement through setting up some of Robert's previous works

## Structure

For 4 credits of work, 12 hours per week are expected.

While some courses separate learning and project work across the semester, this ISR-G will involve multiple concurrent projects.

On a weekly basis this will generally break down as:
- 6 hours for group work: the penny robot, sculptures, and group projects
- 4 hours outside working on personal art projects
- 2 hours in person: critiques, check-ins, and discussions

## Assessment Plan

Several deliverables will be available at the end of the semester:
- the assembled and improved penny machine
- 3+ personal art projects (w/ documentation and writeups)

These projects will be evaluated with effort-based grading.

### Olin Learning Outcomes

#### Acquire Knowledge, Skills and Approaches

_Build the appropriate breadth and depth of content, techniques and methodologies from diverse fields._

Between the personal art projects, penny robot, and readings, I expect to learn and apply several techniques and framings from the "art world" as well as gain experience in fabrication and electromechanical projects.

<!-- #### Think Critically

_Engage in analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, and applying diverse information and experiences to support decision-making, attitude formation, action and expression._ -->

#### Develop and Apply Creativity

_Generate novel ideas and approaches, taking into account authentic constraints, that lead to innovative outcomes._

The personal art projects are inherently creative work, and work on the penny machine is involves many constraints and is going to require creative solutions.

#### Communicate Effectively

_Express meaning successfully through oral, written, and visual media and listen actively to comprehend the meaning of others._

Effectively communicating your goals and work as an artist is a difficult project. I'll gain experience in that through the write-ups and critiques of the personal art projects.

#### Collaborate Successfully

_Create and maintain successful working relationships and identify and resolve interpersonal teaming conflicts to achieve a common goal._

I'll be working with Robert and a couple other students on the penny machine and any other group projects that come up.

#### Plan and Execute

_Scope, plan and implement projects, maintain accountability for contributions, continuously evaluate progress, navigate uncertainty and adversity, and iterate as needed._

In addition to scoping, planning, and implementing this ISR-G, I'll be structuring the personal art projects, and we'll be reevaluating goals and progress on the penny machine continuously.

#### Become Self-Directed Learners

_Identify and address learning needs through setting goals, selecting resources and maintaining self-accountability to develop and support intellectual curiosity._

A lot of this work will be in new technical and arts-related areas for me, so a fair bit of research and learning will be required along the way.

#### Foster Identity Development

_Identify and reflect on key moments in life and connect them to the development of oneâ€™s sense of self._

I'll have the opportunity to explore, learn about, and reflect on creating art - something that I think will lead to a lot of personal development.
