For my first art project as part of my [Pennies and Personal Art Projects ISR](/tags/papap-isr), I've decided to work with ascii images made with my Panasonic KX-P1124 dot-matrix printer. On Tuesday I brought in some pieces I made and pinned them up in the Library to share with Robert.

This past week I finished making an image-to-ascii converter ([source available on GitHub](https://github.com/newsch/asciifier)) to generate images, calibrated for the printer's built-in monospace `Courier` font.
Overall, the output is pretty low-contrast, but these photos don't really do them justice. The viewing experience changes very dramatically when close-up vs farther away.

I'll have a more thorough write-up along soonâ„¢, but I wanted to get these photos out there now!

## Next steps

After sharing this with Robert, we discussed a variety of paths forward, regarding techniques and potential work.

### Potential Subjects

- continue with portraits, playing on different levels of antiquity
  - use real frames for portraits
- further referencing antiquity
- explore scale more
  - how small can you go while still remaining recognizable?
  - how large of a piece is feasible?
- using subject material that further relates to dot-matrix printers and their usage
  - the asteroid photo brought to mind the Apollo era for both Robert and Jeff
- use the continual fading of the cartridge in a piece
- explore basic gradients and shapes
- use abstract source material
- copper etchings
- fossils, footprints w/ smooth gradients
- use the form of the pages more
  - center vertically and horizontally
  - include titles, artist statements, etc. on the pages
- use the form of the pages less: remove the guide strips, hide in frames

### Process

- read up on and try some other methods of ascii image generation
- print red, green, and blue channels separately
- try dithering
- try different inks, with multiple colors
  - start with thinner inks, maybe alcohol-based like sharpie
  - make sure I have a solvent for them to clean the print head
  - look for other people who have done this
- try different papers and mediums
  - look for materials that would increase contrast, change brightness
- add some active cooling to the print head to increase speed
